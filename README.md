## Lessons

Explore our exciting lessons with wrestling superstars:
1. [The Basics: Python Piledriver](lesson1/)
   - Taught by none other than The Rock Himself  
   - <div><a href="/images/rock.jfif"><img src="/images/rock.jfif" alt="Professor Jabroni" width="250"/></a></div>
   - Prepare to layeth the smackdown on your code as you step into the grand stage of VSCODE IDE. This is where you install the Python, the best tag partner you could ask for, on your Windows PC and set up a virtual environment for a clash of the coding titans. This ring is set, now it's your turn to bring the crowd to its feet.

2. [Variables and Functions: Grappling with Code](lesson2/)
   - Instuctor ... Stone Cold himslef 
   - Alright, you mud holes, we're crackin' open a can of Python and raisin' hell with variables and functions! And if you're ready to stomp a hole in code and walk it dry, gimme a 'Hell Yeah

4. [Loops and Logic: Submission Holds in Programming](lesson3/)
   - Get ready to lay the smackdown on text as you dissect it into tokens, understanding the counts and the critical role they play. This is where you break down the promo, word by word, making sure each one knows its role in the grand scheme of text processing. No more jabroni talk, it's time for some real action.

5. [Data Structures: Body Slamming Data](lesson4/)
   - Like a true champion making an electrifying entrance, prepare your text for the coding showdown by importing it with style and finesse. This ain't about any jabroni entrance; this is about making a statement, making the crowd feel the electricity as you stride into the coding arena.

6. [Machine Learning 101: The Royal Rumble](lesson5/)
   - Step into the squared circle of parsing where you'll body slam text, extracting every ounce of value from it. This is not for the faint of heart; this is where coding meets WrestleMania, and only the strong will prevail. It‚Äôs your time to shine, to show what you‚Äôre cooking in the coding ring!

7. [Stopwords: The Jabronis of Text Processing](lesson6/)
   - Identify and give the Rock Bottom to the jabronis of your text - the stopwords. These unimportant words have no place in the ring of meaningful analysis. It's time to "Know your role and shut your mouth!", stopwords. This ring is reserved for the champions of text.

8. [Regular Expressions: Submission Holds for Text](lesson7/)
   - Get ready to put your text in a submission hold with the power of regular expressions. This is where you lock it down, extract the value, and leave the rest tapping out on the mat. Like The Rock‚Äôs signature Sharpshooter, your text won‚Äôt know what hit it.

9. [Stemming and Lemmatization: Cutting Promos Short](lesson8/)
   - Take a leaf from The Rock's book as you cut through the fluff, simplifying words to their root form. Just like cutting a promo short and sweet, making every word count. No time for jabroni talk, it‚Äôs time to get straight to the point.

10. [Tagging Parts of Speech: Assigning Titles to Words](lesson9/)
   - Just as The Rock wore many titles in his illustrious career, assign the rightful titles to words identifying nouns, verbs, and more. Every word has a role in the text arena, make sure they know it, and wear it with pride.

11. [Final Challenge: The Coding Cage Match](lesson10/)
    - The stage is set for the ultimate coding showdown. Step into the unforgiving cage of challenges, applying all you‚Äôve learned in a no-holds-barred coding brawl. This is the Hell in a Cell of coding, where only the true champions will have the last word, echoing the Rock‚Äôs iconic, ‚ÄúCan you smell what the code is cooking?‚Äù.
