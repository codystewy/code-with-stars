# Data Analysis with Excel using F1 Race Data

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis using Excel with a real-world example of Formula 1 (F1) race data. The example focuses on analyzing lap data from a fictional F1 race at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas.

## Workflow for Excel Data Analysis

### 1. Data Collection
**Requirement:** Gather lap time data for each driver in an F1 race.
- Hint: Data can be sourced from official race timings or simulated datasets.

### 2. Data Preparation
**Requirement:** Import the CSV data into Excel and prepare it for analysis.
- Hint: Use Excel functions like `TEXT TO COLUMNS` and `DATA CLEANUP` tools.

### 3. Data Exploration
**Requirement:** Examine the dataset for patterns, outliers, or insights.
- Hint: Utilize sorting and filtering capabilities in Excel.

### 4. Data Visualization
**Requirement:** Create visual representations of the data.
- Hint: Explore line charts for lap times and bar charts for comparative analysis.

### 5. Data Analysis
**Requirement:** Perform advanced analysis on the dataset.
- Hint: Calculate averages, fastest laps, and use functions like `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, and `VLOOKUP`.

### 6. Interpretation and Reporting
**Requirement:** Draw conclusions and prepare a report of your findings.
- Hint: Summarize data insights and create a narrative around the data.

## Dataset
